  Dear Sir/Madam,

  My name is Khanh, and I'm a careful software engineer with more than 10 years of experience.
  In addition, I have 2 years of experience working as a DevOps engineer guy.
  I'm currently working as a freelancer and teaching some courses relating to designing and programming at the university level.

  I enjoy thinking deeply before writing code as well as having a curious mindset about how the different components fit together.
  Working with various languages, IDEs, platforms, and frameworks is what I accumulated over years and I'm really inspired by opportunities to work with something new to widen my tech stack.

  Besides, I gained a strong background in algorithms throughout a couple of years as a researcher.

  Working in your group will be my best opportunity to show you my best. I'm looking forward to hearing the answer from you soon.

          + Led an IoT team of 3 staff to research and build all products.
          + Deployed 500+ above products at clients' factories.
          + Managed to bridge the gap between the software development team and IT operation guys at the client sites: deploy software releases as quickly as possible,
          ensure services are easily scalable as well as have the ability of high availability, and protect servers against hackers.
          + Played the role of purchasing relating to various electronic components.
          + Set up mass production processes of all company products.

          SELab was established in 2002 where I significantly gained knowledge from various types of research and leveled up my skills. I very much
          appreciate the time everybody spent with me when I was here.

          + Developed an ASM/C Compiler for a domestic 8-bit MCU named SG8V1.
          + Built a time attendance system on [S3C2440 ARM9](http://www.friendlyarm.net/products/mini2440) board. The cool thing is that
          each user's fingerprint minutiae are stored in their RFID tag instead of using a centralized database.
          + Built a MIFARE reader/writer using [RC522](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/MFRC522.pdf) MCU. This reader supports various kinds of MIFARE tags,
          such as 1K/4K, Ultralight, and DESFire EV1.
          + Created a data capture device via RS232 & USB interface. This device will be plugged into a bill printer to collect every single byte of data printed.
          + Played Technical Manager role in [Renesas Car Rally](https://www.renesas.com/us/en/about/car-rally) which has been held at the University of Science
          for every student in Southern Vietnam. [Take a look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6xDSP0UO4M) at how this race is fun.

          ZenithTek was a high-tech startup founded in Vietnam in 2012 in which we mainly focused on improving the operational efficiency of firms.
          The company went out of business after three years.

          + Worked with a hardware guy to design and develop a compact device named "Mini Terminal" that is similar to Raspberry Pi. In order to make it,
          we chose the STM32F4 series from ST as the main MCU and FreeRTOS as the real-time os for applications.
          + Created a hacked version of the tape dispenser named "M-800 Entry" in which an in-house board was injected into their original one to make it smarter.
          + Deployed nearly 150 Mini Terminal devices that closely integrated with our web applications on quality control lines in clientâ€™s factories => completely replaced paperwork and improved performance by around 20%.
          + Played Office Administrator role.

          + Developed a lightweight USB host library running on the MCB2388 evaluation board. This library complies with USB 2.0 Specification
          and provides three USB classes including Audio, Human Interface Device (HID), and Mass Storage.
          + Applied version control principle to manage and track changes to code and assets across the USB project using SVN software.
