  Dear Sir/Madam,

  My name is Khanh, and I am a careful embedded software engineer with more than 10 years of experience.
  In addition, I have 2 years experience of working as a DevOps engineer guy.

  I enjoy thinking deeply before writing code as well as having a curious mindset on how the different components fit together.
  I have been working with various languages, IDEs, Development Boards, Peripherals, and I'm really inspired by opportunities to work with something new but practical.

  Besides, I also have a strong background in data structure and algorithms throughout a couple of years as a researcher.

  Working in your company will be my best opportunity to show you my best. I'm looking forward to hearing answer from you soon.

          + Led an IoT team of 3 staff to research and build embedded products.
          + Deployed 500+ embedded devices at clients' factories.
          + Managed to bridge the gap between the software development team and IT operation guys at the client sites: deploy software releases as quickly as possible,
          ensure services are easily scalable as well as have the ability of high availability, and protect servers against hackers.
          + Played the role of purchasing relating to various electronic components.
          + Set up mass production processes for company's products.

          + Developed an ASM/C Compiler for a domestic 8-bit MCU named SG8V1.
          + Built a time attendance system on S3C2440-ARM9-based board. The cool thing is that
          each user's fingerprint minutiae is stored in their RFID tag instead of using a centralized database.
          + Built a MIFARE reader/writer using MFRC522 MCU. This reader supports various kinds of MIFARE tags,
          such as 1K/4K, Ultralight and DESFire EV1.
          + Created a data capture device via RS232 and USB interface. This device will be plugged into a bill printer to collect every single byte of data printed.
          + Played Technical Manager role in Renesas Car Rally which has been held at University of Science for every student in the Southern of Vietnam.

          + Worked with a hardware guy to design and develop a compact embedded device that is similar to Raspberry Pi.
          + Created a hacked version of a tape dispenser device in which an in-house board was injected into the original device to make it smarter.
          + Deployed nearly 150 embedded devices that closely integrated with web applications on quality control lines in clients' factories => completely replaced paperwork and improved performance by around 20%.
