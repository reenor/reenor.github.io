  Dear Sir/Madam,
  
  My name is Khanh, and I'm a careful embedded software engineer with more than 10 years of experience.
  In addition, I have 2 years experience of working as a DevOps engineer guy.
  Don't have a lot on my plate like before, I'm currently just teaching some courses relating to programming at the university level.
  
  I enjoy thinking deeply before writing code as well as having a curious mindset on how the different components fit together.
  I have worked with various languages, IDEs, Development Boards, Peripherals, and I'm really inspired by opportunities to work with something new but practical.

  Besides, I gained a strong background in algorithms throughout a couple of years as a researcher.
  
  Working in your company will be my best opportunity to show you my best. I'm looking forward to hearing answer from you soon.

          SELab was established in 2002 where I significantly gained knowledge from various types of research and leveled up my skills. I very much
          appreciate the time everybody spent for me when I was here.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          + Developed an ASM/C Compiler for a domestic 8-bit MCU named SG8V1.
          + Built a time attendance system on [S3C2440 ARM9](http://www.friendlyarm.net/products/mini2440) board. The cool thing is that
          each user's fingerprint minutiae is stored in their RFID tag instead of using a centralized database.
          + Built a MIFARE reader/writer using [RC522](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/MFRC522.pdf) MCU. This reader supports various kinds of MIFARE tag,
          such as 1K/4K, Ultralight and DESFire EV1.
          + Created a data capture device via RS232 & USB interface. This device will be plugged into a bill printer to collect every single byte of data printed.
          + Played Technical Manager role in [Renesas Car Rally](https://www.renesas.com/us/en/about/car-rally) which has been held at University of Science
          for every student in the Southern of Vietnam. [Take a look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6xDSP0UO4M) at how this race is fun.

          ZenithTek was a hightech startup founded in Vietnam in 2012 in which we mainly focused on improving operational effeciency of firms.
          The company went out of business after three years.
        description: | # this will include new
          + Worked with a hardware guy to design and develop a compact device named "Mini Terminal" that is similar to Raspberry Pi. In order to make it,
          we chose STM32F4 series from ST as the main MCU and FreeRTOS as the real-time os for applications.
          + Created a hacked version of the tape dispenser named "M-800 Entry" in which an in-house board was injected into their original one to make it smarter.
          + Deployed nearly 150 Mini Terminal devices that closely integrated with our web applications on quality control lines in clientâ€™s factories => completely replaced paperwork and improved performance by around 20%.
          + Played Office Administrator role.

          The laboratory where I did my thesis had established a partner relationship with NXP Vietnam; therefore, I luckily had a chance to carry out the thesis
          under expert guidance and the professional workplace.

          + Developed a lightweight USB host library running on the MCB2388 evaluation board. This library complies with USB 2.0 Specification
          and provides three USB classes including Audio, Human Interface Device (HID) and Mass Storage.
          + Applied version control principle to manage and track changes to code and assets across the USB project using SVN software.
